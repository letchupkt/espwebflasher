# This is a placeholder firmware file
# Replace this with your actual ESP32 firmware binary
# The file should be a compiled .bin file for ESP32

# To add your firmware:
# 1. Delete this file
# 2. Copy your firmware.bin file here
# 3. Make sure it's named exactly "firmware.bin"

# Example firmware files you might have:
# - esp32_project.bin
# - main.bin  
# - firmware_v1.0.bin

# Just rename your .bin file to "firmware.bin" and place it in this folder
